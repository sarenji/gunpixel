Made for "node knockout":http://nodeknockout.com/, a 48-hour contest for "node.js":http://nodejs.org/!

This was made with node.js, using many libraries/frameworks:

* express
* socket.io
* node-boilerplate

If we had time, we'd use redis! And to fix the leaderboard, and to add individual rooms, team play, fog of war, and new types of weapons...

But we had only 48 hours.
